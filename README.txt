I Love You - site (ready)

Folder structure:
- index.html            (password gate -> flower -> memories)
- memories.html         (main page: timer, images, audio)
- ending.html
- styles.css
- gate_script.js
- mem_script.js
- media/memo/           (place your files here)

What you must add before uploading:
1) Put your 3 photos in `media/memo/` and name them exactly: 1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg
2) Put your audio file (song) as `media/memo/song.mp3`
3) Optional: replace `media/memo/amr.png` with an album art image (same name)

Then upload the folder to GitHub (or Vercel). The site will work as:
- Open index.html -> enter password `lolo` -> the rose screen appears -> click rose -> message appears -> click "Love you" to go to memories page.
- On memories page press Play to play the local `song.mp3`.
